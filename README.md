# FED-CA2

First i created html page where the user will give his name and nick name and a play button to move to the next page.

Then i created signpg to select the level of difficulty they want and there are easy medium and hard level and instruction will be provided below the level and it will be a popup message.

Then i created html css and javascript for each level and in each level the number of tiles increases and you should find it within one min and each time the the images will appear in random positions to make it more interesting.
Then at last i created two end page where if the user completes befor the time runs out the user it will take the user to Congratulations page where it will tell that the user has found all the maching cards aqnd it will display the scores and if the user was not able to complete befor the time runs out it will take you to a page where it tells sorry your times up and display the score and if the user wants they can play again by clicking play again button.
